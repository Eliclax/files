# MO Server

## What's MO Server?

MO Server is a Discord server dedicated to the discussion of Mathematical Olympiads. You can join the Discord server through the following invite link: https://discord.gg/m22vNrX. It's a growing community of competition math enthusiasts with over 500 members currently. You can learn more about our server and the features we offer at the bottom. <br>

At the moment, this GitHub repository hosts two categories of files: PoTD and Contests. <br>

### PoTDs

PoTD is an abbreviation for "Problem of the Day".  These are problems posted daily (~~mostly, we do forget sometimes~~) by the Problem Curators (they will have a Problem Curators role in the Discord server). These are quite varied in difficulty and content, ranging from easy beginner questions to ones which are as hard as IMO P3/6. 

#### Understanding PoTD Codes

Next to each problem name you'll see a 2 or 3 letter code.

Here it is `N4`. The `N` represents the type of problem - `A` for Algebra, `C` for Combinatorics, `G` for Geometry, and `N` for Number Theory. <br>

The `4` represents the difficulty of the problem. Problems range from difficulty `1` (easy beginner problems which are almost trivial, as example being "Prove that there are no 1999 primes in an arithmetic progression that are all less than 12345.") to `5-6` (IMO P1/4) to `9-10` (IMO P3/6). <br>

So there are a wide variety of problems available here. 

### Contests

Contests are server-run contests. These run every month (usually on the first or second weekend of each month). They alternate between beginner (months which are 1 mod 3), intermediate (months which are 2 mod 3), advanced (months which are 0 mod 3). We have had 3 contests so far. Contests are named according to difficulty - beginner < intermediate < advanced. 

### More about MO Server

**Channels and Categories in this server**
In this server, we have the *General* category which is for general conversation. Note that #lounge is generally "for on-topic discussion of Olympiads or maths in general! For other things go to #chill." <br>
If you are an IMO participant or past participant, we have the *IMO* category to discuss IMO things. <br>
The *Contests* category is for discussion of olympiad mathematics. Please use the appropriate channel. 
*Challenges* are problems which the server moderators and problem curators post. These usually have a difficulty rating ranging from 1 (nearly trivial) to 5-6 (IMO P1/4) to 9-10 (IMO P3/6). <br>
*Reruns* are where we allow members to "sit" past contests such as the EGMO or IMO typically 2 days to a week after the contest has happened. <br>
*Server Contests* are contests which have been made by the server staff. There are 3 difficulties - Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced which rotate each month. <br>
*Input Output* is a game where players input numbers and a bot will tell you the output from those inputs. Players win by being able to guess the function in the least number of inputs. <br>
*Tutorials* are sessions where some people teach others. They will run soon. <br>
*Livesolving* is where people stream themselves solving difficult olympiad problems for the first time. This is always entertaining to watch!<br>
