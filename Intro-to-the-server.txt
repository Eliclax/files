**What's Discord?**
Discord is a free chat software where people from the internet can communicate with each other, by joining *servers* (similar to "group chats" in other apps). Although Discord is generally marketed as being "for gamers", it is very versatile and can be applied to a wide range of contexts, including, as our server has done, Maths Olympiad. 

**Channels**
There are two kinds of channels in Discord - text and voice channels. 
*Text Channels* are places where you can post text, images and video to other members of the server. These channels are usually where most conversations occur. 
*Voice Channels* allow for voice communication. These are most often used during contests or groupsolving - or even listening to music together. 

**Roles**
Discord allows for a set of *roles* to be distributed to different members in the server, which allow you to see different parts of the server, or to express your interest in various activities which might be happening in the server. For example, the "contests" role allows you to express your interest in participating in server-held contests. 
You can self-assign roles by clicking on the "reactions" - little emojis under the messages - in #info. 

**Users, UserIDs, Userlists, and bots**
*Users* are (~~supposedly~~) real people, like you and many of the people you will encounter on Discord. Each user has their own *userID*, which you can see by enabling developer mode in settings (User Settings, bottom left -> Appearence -> Developer Mode). This is useful when submitting for MO Server contests, as we require you to name your files using your userID for easy identification (since your userID does not change if you change your username). 
*Bots* are, well, bots! They are small applications running which improve the flow of the server. For instance, by DMing @Staff Mail#8249 you will send a message to all staff, which can be useful sometimes. Another example is @Zira#9472 which assigns roles based on reactions. Or, @Paradøx#5004 which is able to parse and compile LaTeX in text channels. 

**Private Messages**
Sometimes you might want to discuss a solution to a problem, or something that you might want to discuss privately with another member of the server. For this you can Private Message someone by clicking their name in chat and typing where it says "Message ____". You can also start a Group DM where you can invite up to 10 people to a chat. 

**Channels and Categories in this server**
In this server, we have the *General* category which is for general conversation. Note that #lounge is generally "for on-topic discussion of Olympiads or maths in general! For other things go to #chill."
If you are an IMO participant or past participant, we have the *IMO* category to discuss IMO things. 
The *Contests* category is for discussion of olympiad mathematics. Please use the appropriate channel. 
*Challenges* are problems which the server moderators and problem curators post. These usually have a difficulty rating ranging from 1 (nearly trivial) to 5-6 (IMO P1/4) to 9-10 (IMO P3/6). 
*Reruns* are where we allow members to "sit" past contests such as the EGMO or IMO typically 2 days to a week after the contest has happened. 
*Server Contests* are contests which have been made by the server staff. There are 3 difficulties - Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced which rotate each month. 
*Input Output* is a game where players input numbers and a bot will tell you the output from those inputs. Players win by being able to guess the function in the least number of inputs.
*Tutorials* are sessions where some people teach others. They will run soon. 
*Livesolving* is where people stream themselves solving difficult olympiad problems for the first time. This is always entertaining to watch!
